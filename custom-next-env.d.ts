// NOTE: This should be kept up to date with changes to the automatically
// generated next-env.d.ts, but with the reference to next/image-types/global
// excluded.
//
// We have our own type file @types/images.d that overrides the module
// declaration for *.svg. That file should also be kept up to date with
// next/image-types/global.d.ts except for the changes to *.svg
